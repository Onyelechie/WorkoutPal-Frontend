## Our current structure
  - app
    - Main App.tsx. Contains our routes to specific pages (AppRoutes.tsx)
  - assets
    - Images used in the app (we have none at the moment)
  - components
    - Reusable .tsx code to be used on pages (Dashboard, Header, WeeklyGrid, etc.)
  - hooks
    - Hooks that fetch data from the backend and sets the state of the app or any other re-useable hooks
    - Encapsulates logic, decouples UI layer (components) from logic (e.g.) API requests
    - Avoids clutter in components
  - pages
    - The **main pages** (Landing, RoutineBuilder, Login, Register, etc.). 
    - These main pages are made up of specific components bundled together and other miscellaneous html code.
  - styles
    - global.css that is used across the entire app
  - types
    - Includes interfaces / types used for enforcing what kind of data should a variable hold.
  - services
    - Acts as an extra layer for specific data fetches from the backend
    - Feature related
  - utils
    - __unit_tests__
      - keeps actual tests close to the code being tested
      - mainly logic utility classes
